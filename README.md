# Airbnb-London
Business problem- 
1. Have to perform various EDA 
2. Try various Feature Engineering if possible
3. Train a model to detect the price using MSE(Mean Sqare Error) as KPI(Key Performance Index)

First, we have to select relevant features to analyze. I had read various blogs and got to find only 20 features are relevant you can find the notebook below

Second, We have to preprocess the data as well as we have to perfor the data cleaning operation. Link to relevant notebook is below

Third, I had tried to do feature engineering by converting the description to Tf-Idf vectors and converting the other categorical features to numerical one. you can find the notebook link below
<a>https://github.com/raviranjan0631/Airbnb-London-/blob/master/3.%20Feature%20Engg%20and%20Modelling.ipynb</a>

Fourth, I had performed text Mining as well Link to notebook is below

Fifth, EDA based on Latitude, Longitude. You can find the link to notebook below
